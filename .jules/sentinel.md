## 2025-05-15 - Path Traversal in Filename Sanitization
**Vulnerability:** Insufficient filename sanitization in `extractor.py` and `extractor_bc3.py` allowed path traversal via `..` and creation of hidden files via leading dots.
**Learning:** Simply removing common illegal characters like `/` or `\` is not enough if the resulting string can still be `..` or start with a dot, which can lead to files being written outside the intended directory or being hidden.
**Prevention:** Always strip leading and trailing dots and spaces from filenames after removing illegal characters, and provide a fallback name if the resulting string is empty.
